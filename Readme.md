When you click on the generate password button, a series of messages should pop up consecutively.
First it asks for a number between 8 and 128. You can input any number between these two, including 8 and 128, but any other input will result in an error message and return you to the page where you can try again.
Then it asks you consecutively if you want UPPERCASE, Numbers, and Special characters, and asks for a Y/N input. If you input anything other than Y/N it returns an error and reminds you that Y and N are case sensitive.
The program then loops through an array a number of times based on the number you specified at the start.
You recieve an alert with your new password generated.
